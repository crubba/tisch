# A systematic approach to LaTeX tables
*tisch* allows to convert R data frames into LaTeX tables. Presently, *tisch* provides three advantages over other packages with similiar ambition:

1. Intricate table designs: When the data  hierarchical order in the rows and columns 
2. Consistent API: *tisch* provides a succinct DSL for generating tables and manipulating table elements
3. Theme-based: Theme elements can be

## Using tisch: An example
We illustrate the generation of a tisch table with the french_fries data set from the reshape2 package:

```{r, eval = F}
library(tisch)
data("browsershares")

tt <- tisch(browsershares, rows = c("year", "month"), sep = " >> ") +
  theme(
    row_style = ragged(indent = 0.4)
  ) + 
  caption("Browser market share in 2011-2013") +
  footnote("Note: Information taken from StatCounter. StatCounter reports desktop and mobile browser share separately; we report them together. For consistency, each desktop browser share has been reduced by multiplying it by the current overall desktop share versus mobile. Similarly, mobile browser shares have each been multiplied by the overall mobile percentage")

to_tex(tt)
```

This code gives us the following output:

## Disclaimer
*tisch* is in a very early development stage. Part of the API are likely to change in future versions.
